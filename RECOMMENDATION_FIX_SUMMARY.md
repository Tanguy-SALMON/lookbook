# Recommendation Engine Fix Summary

## Problem Solved

The Lookbook-MPC recommendation engine was only returning single tops (like "RIBBED TANK TOP") without matching bottoms, making incomplete outfit recommendations. Users would get responses like:

**Before Fix:**
```
User: "I need something for a business meeting"
Response: "I found 1 great outfit for you."
- RIBBED TANK TOP ฿790
```

**After Fix:**
```
User: "I need something for a business meeting"  
Response: "I found 2 great outfits for you."
- Professional Coordinated Set: RIBBED HENLEY T-SHIRT + HIGH-RISE DENIM SHORTS ฿2580
- Professional Coordinated Set: SLIM RIBBED COTTON TANK TOP + HIGH-RISE DENIM SHORTS ฿2580
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **SQL Parameter Mismatch**: The search query had a parameter count error causing 0 results
2. **Overly Restrictive Color Matching**: Color compatibility logic excluded valid combinations like `blue` + `denim-blue`
3. **Missing Category Balance**: No fallback mechanism to ensure both tops and bottoms were found

## Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed SQL Parameter Error (`smart_recommender.py:378`)
```python
# BEFORE (broken)
query = f"""... LIMIT %s"""
params.append(limit)

# AFTER (fixed)
query = """... LIMIT %s""".format(search_clause)
params.append(limit)
```

### 2. Enhanced Color Compatibility (`smart_recommender.py:869-891`)
```python
# BEFORE (restrictive)
compatible_pairs = {
    "black": ["white", "grey", "beige"],
    "white": ["black", "grey", "navy", "beige"],
}

# AFTER (permissive)
compatible_pairs = {
    "black": ["white", "grey", "beige", "navy", "blue", "denim-blue"],
    "white": ["black", "grey", "navy", "beige", "blue", "denim-blue"],
    "blue": ["white", "black", "grey", "navy", "denim-blue"],
    "denim-blue": ["black", "white", "navy", "grey", "blue"],
}

# Fallback: Allow unknown color combinations
return True  # Be permissive for unknown colors
```

### 3. Added Category Balance Logic (`smart_recommender.py:594-679`)
```python
async def _ensure_category_balance(self, cursor, products, keywords, limit):
    """Ensure we have both tops and bottoms for complete outfits."""
    grouped = self._group_products_by_category(products)
    
    has_tops = len(grouped.get('top', [])) > 0
    has_bottoms = len(grouped.get('bottom', [])) > 0
    
    if not has_tops:
        tops = await self._search_specific_category(cursor, 'top', keywords, 3)
        products.extend(tops)
    
    if not has_bottoms:
        bottoms = await self._search_specific_category(cursor, 'bottom', keywords, 3)
        products.extend(bottoms)
```
