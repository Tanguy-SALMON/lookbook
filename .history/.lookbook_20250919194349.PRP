I want to create a small framwork in python.
The goal is to provide and that provide an API for an LLM with this service.
It about fashion, for the COS brand.
Whan the request is: "What should I waer for the next week?"
The server must check what week we are, check even, and if the next week its christamast, avise some lookbook mostly in green and red, a bit cusual.
For that, the server muct to have all clothing description in database.
For that, I sugest to have an LLM with vision capability to describe clothing.
I have already some successful like file in image, works well with Ollama. Can store info in a Mysql database
