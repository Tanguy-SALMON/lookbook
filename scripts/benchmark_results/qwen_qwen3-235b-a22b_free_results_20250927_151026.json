They want a concise answer under 120 words, with 4-6 short bullet points and no headings. \n\nFirst, I need to recall practical clothing items that work well in high heat. Lightweight fabrics are key - think cotton, linen, rayon. Swimsuits are obvious but should mention quick-dry materials. Cover-ups are important for sun protection between swims. Footwear needs to be sand-friendly like flip-flops. \n\nHmm, should I include hats? Yes, wide-brimmed ones for UV protection. Sunglasses too - polarized lenses reduce glare. Maybe skip mentioning specific brands since they didn't ask. \n\nWait, the user said \"hot weather\" specifically, so I'll avoid anything heavy like denim. Focus on breathability. Also no need for jackets or long sleeves unless specified. \n\nLet me count the bullets: swimsuit, cover-up, hat, sunglasses, flip-flops... that's five. Perfect. Need to keep descriptions super short - \"quick-dry\" instead of \"made from quick-drying fabric\". \n\nWord count check: current draft is about 90 words. Good. And all items are strictly beach-relevant - no random suggestions like \"pack sunscreen\" since they only asked for clothes.\n</think>\n\n- Lightweight cotton or linen cover-ups dry fast and keep you cool after swimming.  \n- Quick-dry swimsuits in breathable fabrics prevent chafing and discomfort in intense heat.  \n- Wide-brimmed straw hats shield your face and neck from harsh UV rays effectively.  \n- Polarized sunglasses protect eyes from glare and reduce squinting in bright sunlight.  \n- Flip-flops or slide sandals offer easy on/off access and won\u2019t trap sand.",
